### Known bug fixes already applied
- `getTierPrice()` crash on empty `pricingTiers[]` — guarded in `lib/shop/pricing.ts`
- Retail shop "No results" — price filter now skips products with `priceRetail === 0`
- Dealer warehouse filter "No results" — derives real warehouse IDs from product data (not hardcoded)
- Dealer page 404 — route now works at `/shop?mode=dealer`

---

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, `proxy.ts` convention), React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first `@theme` tokens in `globals.css`)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **State:** Zustand v5 (`useShopStore`, `useFilterStore`)
- **Data:** TanStack Query v5 + Supabase + Prisma (489 real products)
- **i18n:** Custom (`lib/i18n.ts` + `LanguageContext`)

## Database (Supabase)
```
public.profiles         — one row per user, role = 'customer' or 'dealer'
public.products         — 489 rows (real tyre inventory)
public.warehouses       — 2 rows: Warehouse 1, Warehouse 2
public.inventory        — stock quantity per product per warehouse
public.pricing_tiers    — volume pricing for dealers (empty — see TO DO #1)
public.orders           — retail orders (bank_transfer / cod), guest or logged-in
public.order_items      — line items per order, snapshots product name/sku/price
```
All 489 products currently have `price_retail = 0` / `price_dealer = 0` (ERP export had no prices yet — shop shows "ติดต่อสอบถามราคา" / "Contact for pricing").

---

## TO DO — Ordered by Priority

### 1. Add Prices (When ERP Has Them)
All 489 products have `price_retail = 0` and `price_dealer = 0`.

- **Option A — ERP exports a price file (fastest):** put the CSV in `stock data/` and ask Claude Code to match by SKU/size and update `price_retail` / `price_dealer`.
- **Option B — Manual:** Supabase Table Editor → `products` → edit `price_retail` / `price_dealer` per row.
- **Option C — Dealer volume tiers** (run in Supabase SQL Editor once retail prices exist):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO public.pricing_tiers (product_id, min_qty, max_qty, price_per_unit)
  SELECT id, 1, 9, price_retail * 0.85 FROM public.products WHERE price_retail > 0;
  INSERT INTO public.pricing_tiers (product_id, min_qty, max_qty, price_per_unit)
  SELECT id, 10, 39, price_retail * 0.80 FROM public.products WHERE price_retail > 0;
  INSERT INTO public.pricing_tiers (product_id, min_qty, max_qty, price_per_unit)
  SELECT id, 40, NULL, price_retail * 0.75 FROM public.products WHERE price_retail > 0;
  ```

### 2. Re-import Stock When ERP File Changes
```bash
cd "C:\Users\WINDOWS 11\Desktop\tyre on cloud\tirehub"
node scripts/import-stock.mjs "C:\Users\WINDOWS 11\Desktop\tyre on cloud\stock data\YOUR-NEW-FILE.csv"
```
Uses `ON CONFLICT (sku) DO UPDATE` — safe to re-run.

### 3. Set Up User Authentication (Customer + Dealer Login) — ✅ Done (2026-06-23)
Backend (RLS, `profiles.role`, role-aware `/api/products`) already existed from an earlier session but was never wired to the UI. This session finished the loop:
- `context/SupabaseSessionProvider.tsx` now also resolves and exposes `role` (fetched from `profiles`, server-prefetched in `app/layout.tsx` to avoid a flash of logged-out UI) plus a `signOut()` helper.
- New shared `components/shared/AuthControl.tsx` (sign-in link / sign-out button) is wired into both `Navbar.tsx` (landing page) and `ShopHeader.tsx` (shop page, light/dark themed).
- `/shop?mode=dealer` is now actually gated in `components/shop/ShopPageClient.tsx`: anonymous visitors are redirected to `/auth?next=/shop?mode=dealer`; logged-in non-dealers see the new `components/shop/DealerAccessGate.tsx` (LINE contact CTA) instead of the matrix; real dealers see `DealerMatrix` as before.
- `app/auth/page.tsx` now reads a `next` redirect target and routes signed-in users by role (dealer → dealer mode, customer → customer mode) unless `next` says otherwise.
- New users get `profiles.role = 'customer'` automatically; promote to dealer via:
  ```sql
  UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'dealer' WHERE email = 'dealer@example.com';
  ```
- Verified end-to-end with Playwright + a throwaway Supabase test user (created/promoted/deleted via the admin API): anon redirect, customer gate, dealer access after promotion, and sign-out all confirmed working.

### 4. Connect TyreFinder to Real Database — partially done
Size-based search already queries the real DB live (`TyreFinder.tsx` → `hooks/useProducts.ts` → `/api/products?width=&profile=&rimSize=`, indexed Prisma columns, no migration needed). The old dead mock hook `hooks/useFilters.ts`'s `useMatchingTyres()` was removed (2026-06-23) — it had zero call sites. What's still genuinely mock: vehicle/plate lookup (`hooks/useTyreFinder.ts` + `lib/tyreFinder/fitmentData.ts`, 8 hardcoded vehicles / 3 plates) — needs a real vehicle-fitment dataset or external API (e.g. TecDoc, DVLA-style plate lookup). Medium-large effort, mostly external-data-source integration.

### 5. Add Product Images — plumbing done (2026-06-23), real photos still needed
All cards used to show a 🛞 emoji. `image_url` is still NULL for every product, but the plumbing is now in place:
- `types/shop.ts`'s `TyreProduct.imageUrl` (replaces the old `imageEmoji` field) flows through `hooks/useProducts.ts` from the existing `image_url` column.
- New `components/shared/TyreThumbnail.tsx`: renders the real photo via `next/image` when `imageUrl` is set, otherwise a brand-tinted SVG tyre-icon placeholder (deterministic color per brand name — no more bare emoji). Used in `RetailProductCard.tsx`, `DealerCard.tsx`, `DealerRow.tsx`.
- `components/landing/FeaturedCatalog.tsx`'s `ProductCard` shows the real photo when available, otherwise keeps its existing bespoke animated tyre-ring illustration unchanged.
- `next.config.ts` already whitelists `*.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/**` for `next/image` — uploading photos to a **Supabase Storage public bucket** and running `UPDATE public.products SET image_url = '<storage public URL>' WHERE brand = '...'` (or per-SKU) will make them appear immediately, no code changes needed.

### 6. SEO & Metadata — ✅ Done (2026-06-23)
- `app/sitemap.ts` (`/sitemap.xml`) and `app/robots.ts` (`/robots.txt`) added — `/auth` and `/api/` are disallowed (no SEO value; dealer mode isn't listed since it's now gated behind login).
- `app/layout.tsx` and `app/shop/page.tsx` metadata now include `metadataBase`, `alternates.canonical`, `openGraph`, and `twitter` (summary_large_image) blocks.
- `app/opengraph-image.tsx` generates a branded 1200×630 social-preview image on the fly via `next/og` — no static asset needed, auto-applied to all pages' `og:image`.
- `lib/site.ts` holds `SITE_URL` as the single source of truth (currently the Vercel subdomain) — **update this the moment the `tyreoncloud.app` custom domain (TO-DO #10) is attached**, everything else (canonical URLs, sitemap, OG) derives from it.

### 7. Order / Cart / Checkout — ✅ Done for retail (2026-06-23), dealer ordering still RFQ-only
Retail (B2C) checkout is fully built, no payment-gateway account needed (bank transfer / COD only, per owner's choice — no Stripe/Omise costs yet):
- New migration `supabase/migrations/0003_orders.sql` → `public.orders` + `public.order_items` tables. No insert policy for anon/authenticated — orders are only ever created server-side via `POST /api/orders` (`app/api/orders/route.ts`), which **always recomputes prices from the live `products` table**, never trusts a price from the client. Logged-in customers can later read back their own orders (`orders_select_own` RLS policy); guests reference their order number via LINE instead.
- `components/shop/ShopHeader.tsx` now has a cart icon + badge (retail mode only) opening `components/shop/RetailCartDrawer.tsx` (qty stepper, remove, subtotal/total, "Proceed to Checkout").
- `app/checkout/page.tsx` + `components/checkout/CheckoutPageClient.tsx`: delivery-details form, Bank Transfer / Cash-on-Delivery payment choice, order summary, and an inline confirmation view (avoids needing to re-fetch the order under RLS for guests) with an order number and a "Message us on LINE" CTA for bank-transfer payment details.
- Shared `hooks/useRetailCart.ts` joins the `retailCart` store state with live product data and computes totals — used by both the drawer and the checkout page.
- `components/shared/Logo.tsx` gained a `theme="light"` variant (was hardcoded for dark backgrounds only) for the checkout page's white header.
- Verified end-to-end with Playwright: add-to-cart → drawer → checkout form → order created in DB with correct server-computed totals and product snapshot → confirmation screen. Test order deleted after verification.
- **Still not done**: no "my orders" history page for logged-in customers (RLS already supports it, just needs a UI), no order-status admin view (use Supabase Table Editor on `orders`/`order_items` for now), dealer ordering is still the quoting/RFQ workflow via the dealer matrix + LINE (intentionally out of scope — it's a B2B quoting tool, not a self-serve checkout).

### 8. Connect GitHub to Vercel for Auto-Deploy
Currently deploys via manual CLI only (`npx vercel --prod --scope team793s-projects --yes`, after `vercel login` once). Push `tirehub/` to GitHub and connect the repo in the Vercel dashboard for deploy-on-push.

### 9. Dealer Matrix Mobile Layout — ✅ Done (2026-06-23)
Below the `lg` breakpoint, `DealerMatrix` now renders `DealerCard` (new component, card-based) instead of the 10-column table. The table is unchanged and still shown at `lg`+ (horizontally scrollable, first column pinned via `sticky left-0`). Keyboard up/down navigation between qty fields works independently in each layout (separate ref arrays so a hidden layout's inputs never steal focus).

### 10. Connect the `tyreoncloud.app` Custom Domain — on hold (owner's choice, 2026-06-23)
Attached to the Vercel project (`vercel domains add tyreoncloud.app`, done 2026-06-23), but DNS is not configured — `vercel domains inspect tyreoncloud.app` still warns it needs `A tyreoncloud.app 76.76.21.21` set at the registrar. **Owner said they haven't actually registered/paid for this domain yet and wants to finish building the site before paying for hosting/domain** — don't pursue further unless asked. The live site keeps working fine at `tyreoncloud-team793s-projects.vercel.app` in the meantime.
